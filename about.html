            <p id="intro">
            The <b>NORMIEMETER</b> is an <a href="https://onlytothinking.com/">OnlyToThinking</a> project by Brayden Johnson, a 
            public administration student, and was programmed by a friend who would prefer to remain anonymous. It was inspired by 
            "<a href="https://decidingtowin.org/">Deciding to Win</a>", a political strategy study written by Simon Bazelon, 
            Lauren Harper Pope, and Liam Kerr and commissioned by <a href="https://welcome.team/">Welcome</a>. 
            Without <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15-RD5e9yzHqSu_d-5hgHr71x9xuY76gE_kZt0jWawS4/">their research</a>, this quiz would have been impossible.
            <br><br>
            This quiz collects no information about its users, and it is purely intended as a tool to facilitate reflection on 
            the ways in which one's views differ from those of their compatriots.
