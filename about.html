            <p id="intro">
            The NORMIEMETER(TM) is an <a href="https://onlytothinking.com/">OnlyToThinking</a> project by Brayden Johnson, a public administration student, and programmed by a friend who would prefer to remain anonymous. It was inspired by "Deciding to Win", a political strategy study written by Simon Bazelon, Lauren Harper Pope, and Liam Kerr and commissioned by Welcome. Without their research, this quiz would have been impossible (especially given that we ripped question wordings more or less straight from their brilliant study!)
            <br><br>
            This quiz collects no information about its users, and it is purely intended as a tool to facilitate reflection on the ways in which one's views differ from those of their compatriots.
